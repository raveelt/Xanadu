# Xanadu Quantum Codebook
- In this repository I work through the codebook found here: https://codebook.xanadu.ai/ \
- There is a jupyter notebook for each node, where i work through the theory and coding excercises \
- I choose to upload pdfs for some nodes, specifically for the theory exercises for ease
