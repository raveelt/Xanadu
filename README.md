# Xanadu Quantum Codebook
In this repository I work through the codebook found here: https://codebook.xanadu.ai/ \
there is a jupyter notebook for each node, where i work through the excersices and coding excercises. \
I choose to upload pdfs for some excercises as writing it out in latex is time consuming.
